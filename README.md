# Data-Science-Project-on-Stress-Detection-using-Eye-Tracking-Data
Abstract: In this research, we will study how eye tracker data can be used to determine the level of stress that a person is experiencing. It is possible to gauge a person's level of stress based on the way in which their eyes move, the path that their gaze takes, and the size of their pupils. Eye tracker data will be used in this study in an effort to develop a model that will accurately predict levels of stress.
	In order to forecast stress levels based on the eye-tracking data, the study used a variety of machine learning algorithms, including support vector regression, random forest regression, and linear regression. Metrics like as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate the models.
	The project showed that eye-tracking data can predict stress levels. Support vector regression had the highest precision and recall, while random forest regression had the highest accuracy and F1 score. Gaze event duration, pupil diameter left, and eye movement type predicted stress levels well.
	The experiment showed that eye-tracking data may detect stress and that feature and model selection are crucial for successful predictions. The initiative may influence stress detection and intervention technologies in healthcare and education.
